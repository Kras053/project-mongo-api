# Project Mongo API

This week I built an API using MongoDB and mongoose. I used seed data and created routes with app.get() with status codes with try and catch method.

## The problem

If I had more time I would solve why the try and catch method is not working properly, it only returns error for the release_year when letters are typed otherwise all is considered success. 
I'd like to find the correspondent to .includes() method to be able to search and return partly written key words and also more endpoints. Now I could not include cast since it would work if there were only one actor in crew like Christian Morales, but not for Winona Ryder who has other cast members.
